## **You Can Become an Unboxing Influencer**

Unboxing videos are an excellent way to make an impression and gain a larger following on social media channels. These popular videos can cover every type of consumer product imaginable—from home goods and food to toys and tech gadgets. With unboxing video content, you share your honest reactions to and opinions about new products. Many people appreciate unboxing videos because they help them make good purchase decisions. But others experience the vicarious thrill of getting something new without having to spend any money.

To make your mark in the world of unboxing, you need to start with a clear focus. Spend time reflecting on what you love and what you do best. It’s better to have a narrow niche than try to cover too many bases with your unboxing channel. Also, spend time working on your speaking voice. You’ll want to exude personality but be clear and articulate to attract followers.

To start out in unboxing, you’ll need a simple one-camera setup. You can even use a quality cell phone camera at first. Carefully consider the location where you’ll shoot your videos. A clean background and good lighting, along with a table or countertop to display the products, are important for unboxing success.
